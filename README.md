# 📰 News Blog Website

A modern, responsive blog site interface designed entirely using HTML and CSS.

This project was developed to demonstrate how modern web features (Dark Mode, Mobile Menu, Animations) can be implemented using HTML and CSS, which is the first phase of my training. The project is still under development.
